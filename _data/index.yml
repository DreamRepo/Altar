  lead: "Altar is designed for <strong>researchers and engineers</strong> who acquire experimental results — containing metadata, data tables, time series, images, videos, or any files — organized in folders, and want to:"
  benefits:
    - "<strong>Centralize</strong> experiment data in a structured database"
    - "<strong>Filter and sort</strong> results by configuration parameters"
    - "<strong>Access and visualize</strong> data through a user-friendly interface"
    - "<strong>Produce datasets</strong> for further analysis, exchange with collaborators and publication"
  closing: "Whether you're running scientific experiments, ML training runs, or lab measurements — if your data is stored in folders and you need a better way to explore it, Altar can help."

  docker_explanation: "<br><strong>What is Docker?</strong> Docker is like a virtual container that packages all the software Altar needs to run. Think of it as a complete workspace that works the same way on any computer — whether you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux.<br><br><strong>Why it helps:</strong> Instead of manually installing and configuring multiple programs (databases, servers, etc.), Docker does it all automatically in one command. This means less technical setup for you, and more time for your research.<br><br><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/\" target=\"_blank\">Install Docker Desktop here</a> (free for personal use)."
